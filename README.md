This project was built under Graduate Rotational Internship Program (GRIP) by The Sparks Foundation.

## Task-1 : Prediction using Supervised ML
The task is to predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.

The aim was to predict score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/day. The performance of the algorithm was measured using Mean Absolute Error. The Mean Absolute Error observed was around 4.18.
